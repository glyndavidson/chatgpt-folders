## 🔒 Privacy & Security
ChatGPT Folders is designed with privacy first.  
The extension never reads, stores, or shares any of your ChatGPT conversation text.  
It only saves the minimal information required to organise your sidebar:  
- folder names, colours, and structure
- your UI preferences
- ChatGPT conversation IDs only - no titles or content

The extension does not access chat messages, personal information, or anything you type into ChatGPT.  
No data is ever sent to external servers — everything stays inside Chrome’s sync storage under your Google account and can be cleared at any time.

If you wish to review the data, you can download a copy at any time from the extension’s settings.
